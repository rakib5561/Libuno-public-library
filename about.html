            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>
              Knowledge is needed to make life beautiful by refreshing and
              expanding the mind. Reading books is one of the ways to know
              yourself. Reading books independently is essential for students'
              freedom of reading and freedom of thought. Which later played a
              practical role in the formation of the country and the nation. And
              we need a library to read books independently. The library is the
              lifeblood of an educational institution and the bearer of
              knowledge. The more developed the library, the more developed the
              country. Realizing this, Daffodil International University,
              Daffodil Smart City, Ashulia, near the capital Dhaka, has
              established a Daffodil International University Library with an
              area of ​​one lakh ten thousand (70,000) square feet. Where all
              the knowledge of the world, including academic books, such as
              history, religion, politics, economics, culture, culture, etc.,
              are arranged in layers on top of all the new and old alluring
              books. The collection of books in this library is very good, in
              total there is a huge collection of about one lakh (100,000)
              books. Everyone in the DIU community can be a member of this
              library. The system of reading books while sitting is also quite
              nice, 700 users can use this library at a time, there is an
              opportunity to take books home as a member. The library has
              several sections such as Circulation, Cataloging, and Processing,
              Main Stack, Reference and Reserve, Newspaper and Periodical,
              Archives, and Audio Visual Materials to provide smooth and
              efficient library services.

            <h2>Bangabandhu Corner</h2>
            <p>
              Bangabandhu-a name, a landmark, history, and the father of the
              nation. By the call of Bangabandhu, freedom wanted people to take
              part in the liberation war of Bangladesh and achieve victory. This
              corner increases the knowledge on the history of the liberation
              war among the university community. Through this corner, faculty
              and staff members, students, and researchers of the university
              will be able to get a comprehensive idea about Bangabandhu Sheikh
              Mujibur Rahman and the glorious history of the birth of
              Bangladesh, the liberation war. The main objective of this corner
              is to enrich the present generation with information about the
              life, work, philosophy of Bangabandhu, and know the history of the
              liberation war. As a model for other institutions, this corner
              will play a significant role in bridging the gap between history
              and the present generation through its resources. In addition,
              Bangabandhu's glorious contribution was not only in liberating a
              nation but also in leading the task of building the golden Bengal
              of his dreams. Which will play a role in bridging the gap between
              the new generation and the true history of Bangladesh. In addition
              to traditional library services, e-library services are currently
              the most popular. There is also an e-resource browsing center.
              This e-library includes e-books, e-journals, e-magazines, A-Z
              Database including UGC, UDL, and e-resources subscribed to various
              national and international consortiums. Even in this corona
              situation, library services do not stop using contemporary library
              software. Through OpenAthens, users of this library can access
              e-resources from anywhere in the world. There is a search system
              through VuFind due to which there is no need to search in separate
              databases. Besides, there is KOHA, DSpace. Turnitin software is
              used to verify the authenticity of the research reports of
              students and researchers. Just as there are opportunities to read
              books in private in different parts of the library, there is also
              a 'Cafe Library' in another corner, where students can read a book
              while sipping a mug of coffee or eating something light. There is
              free WiFi browsing for readers throughout the library. Which has
              become a dream world for book lovers in the Daffodil community.
              There is no alternative to reading books and sports to keep the
              young generation and youth free from various crimes including
              drugs. Therefore, to make the library accessible to the readers,
              different groups regularly organize ‘lesson-chats’ to exchange
              reading experiences, feelings, perceptions, and opinions of the
              readers. People's mental excellence, transparency in work, social
              responsibility, improved living — above all, I want the library to
              know myself.
            </p>

            <h2>Library Cafe'</h2>
            <p>
              As a growing organism, the collaboration of library services is
              increasing day by day as per demand users' expectations. Cafe
              library or Library Cafe is one of those glorious extensions called
              in the library building for the past few decades. Despite the
              digital revolution, people are returning to libraries to access
              resources that are not available online or just to enjoy the
              atmosphere of these tranquil spots. Sometimes users have to engage
              in painstaking research in libraries. When users are feeling bored
              to research work and need some relaxation to fresh mind, then they
              can use the Cafe Library which is developed beside the stack area.
              It will be a more attractive and serene environment to read while
              enjoying a cup of coffee. In this regard, a cafe in a library or
              Library Cafe may restart users' stamina in their scholastics
              works. It may save library staff time for uninterrupted service
              provision. Hence a Library Cafe creates a peaceful atmosphere for
              studying and exploring the world more interactively. Thus a
              library may be a full force center of creativity, community,
              innovation, and entrepreneurship. Keeping this in mind, for the
              first time in Bangladesh, Daffodil International University is
              providing a Cafe in its library building. This library cafe
              includes food and drinking facilities, floor seating facilities.
              Short time rest and sleeping facilities and so on to restart your
              brainstorm for further study.
